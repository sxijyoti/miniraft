/**
 * Election Logic Module
 * 
 * Handles RAFT leader election process:
 * 1. Election timeout fires → follower becomes candidate
 * 2. Candidate increments term and requests votes from all peers
 * 3. Candidate collects responses
 * 4. If majority votes received → becomes leader
 * 5. If higher term received or timeout → returns to follower
 * 
 * This module does NOT handle the actual HTTP RPC calls (that's in server.js)
 * It focuses on the election state machine and vote tracking.
